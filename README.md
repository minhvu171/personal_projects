The combining\_data folder consists of a Python script that preprocesses three data sources and transforms them into three homogeneous DataFrames. Then, a Venn diagram is created based on these three DataFrames.



The signal(ECG)\_processing\_Python folder consists of a Jupyter notebook with Python code that plots, detects peaks on the waveforms, and applies some filter layers on an Electrocardiography (ECG) signal.



The signal(EEG)\_processing\_MATLAB folder consists of a MATLAB script that plots and applies a filter on an Electroencephalography (EEG) signal.



The evaluate\_ML\_models folder consists of a Jupyter notebook with Python code that designs several Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression and Random Forest) to predict whether a patient is diabetic or not, based on several independent features. Each model is evaluated, and explainable AI techniques are applied to study the importance of each feature to the output of a classifier.



I am responsible for all the code.
